### Context 
Most of the Restaurants ask reviews to the customers and based on the reviews the restaurant can improve the customer satisfaction. So Reviews plays a vital role for the successful growth of the restaurant.  
### Content 
The dataset consists of 1000 rows and 2 columns. Review Column consist of customer reviews and like column consist of 0 and 1. If the review is positive, 1 and if negative, 0.

### Goal 
Apply machine learning algorithms to detect the sentiment from customers' review.
